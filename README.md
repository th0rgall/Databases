Databases
=========

This is a Latex summary of the book used in the databases ("Gegevensbanken", (B-KUL-H01O9A)) course at KU Leuven. The book is written in English, the summary in Dutch. 

The summary includes almost all information from the book and adheres to its structure to the most nested subtitles, but it equally omits almost all examples.

This branch is my fork to which I add additional explanations from the books' examples and other sources (slides) where I think they are useful.

There is also the ``fixes`` branch solely meant for typo and reasoning fixes, in this branch the content of the original summary has not been changed.

## Versions of the book

The book "Fundamentals of Database Systems" by Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe is used as a base text for this summary.

I'm not sure which version of the book the original summary author used, but as far as I can tell the content is almost the same.

Differences of the summary with the "6th edition, Pearson new international edition of 2011" include:
- Chapter 7 of the summary is split into Chapter 7 (ER) and 8 (EER) in the book. The content, including subtitles, seems the same.
