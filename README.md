## Versions of the book

The book "Fundamentals of Database Systems" by Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe is used as a base text for this summary.

I'm not sure which version of the book the original summary author used, but as far as I can tell the content is almost the same.

Differences of the summary with the "6th edition, Pearson new international edition of 2011" include:
- Chapter 7 of the summary is split into Chapter 7 (ER) and 8 (EER) in the book. The content, including subtitles, seems the same.
